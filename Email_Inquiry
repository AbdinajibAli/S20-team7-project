==============

I have been reading your research (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00378.pdf) and find all your work with PRNGs quite valuable. 
I am working on a team (at Middle Tennessee State University, USA) that will possibly be fostering a continuation of you and 
your colleague's work as a part of a neural nets class project. Do any of you happen to have the resources to send me any code
that was used during for this research? This would be a great help to some of us who are just getting exposed to different GAN
architectures and being able to see implementation details from a professional perspective. Again, thank you for your contribution
in this area of neural nets and I look forward to hearing back from you.
