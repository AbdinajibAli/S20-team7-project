    "Sample Abstract:\n",
    "OBJECTIVE: The role of antibiotic therapy in managing acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) in children is controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of high-dose amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate in the treatment of children diagnosed with ABS.\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Children 1 to 10 years of age with a clinical presentation compatible with ABS were eligible for participation. Patients were stratified according to age (<6 or ≥6 years) and clinical severity and randomly assigned to receive either amoxicillin (90 mg/kg) with potassium clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg) or placebo. A symptom survey was performed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30. Patients were examined on day 14. Children’s conditions were rated as cured, improved, or failed according to scoring rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESULTS: Two thousand one hundred thirty-five children with respiratory complaints were screened for enrollment; 139 (6.5%) had ABS. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, and 56 were randomly assigned. The mean age was 6630 months. Fifty (89%) patients presented with persistent symptoms, and 6 (11%) presented with nonpersistent symptoms. In 24 (43%) children, the illness was classified as mild, whereas in the remaining 32 (57%) children it was severe. Of the 28 children who received the antibiotic, 14 (50%) were cured, 4 (14%) were improved, 4(14%) experienced treatment failure, and 6 (21%) withdrew. Of the 28children who received placebo, 4 (14%) were cured, 5 (18%) improved, and 19 (68%) experienced treatment failure. Children receiving the antibiotic were more likely to be cured (50% vs 14%) and less likely to have treatment failure (14% vs 68%) than children receiving the placebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSIONS: ABS is a common complication of viral upper respiratory infections. Amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate results in significantly more cures and fewer failures than placebo, according to parental report of time to resolution.” (9)\n",

    "\n",
    "Society relies on Pseudo-random numbers for a multitude of reasons. Whether the usecases fall in Information Security or, more broadly, modeling and simulation, we think it is important to not only push the boundary for the modern pseudo random number directly, but to also analyze the history of pseudo randomness to aide in that effort.\n",

    "Whether true randomness is a inhibition of the human perception or not, there is clear need to push the modern pseudo-random number closer to converging on perceived \"true\" randomness.\n",

    "Questions/Aim:\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a neural net to predict PRNs from a chosen PRNGs output. We aim to train neural nets to predict values of assigned PRNGs and track attributes of each to make generalized conclusions about the development of PRNGs with respect to time and any PRN correlations we uncover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We predict there will be a positive trend over time on the cryptographic strength of each subsequent PRNG, given the nature of the increasing importance of stronger PRNGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We also predict that as we get into cryptographically stronger generation methods, our prediction success rates (even with learning) will be less effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We expect to uncover correlations in Pseudo-random numbers based on each individual generator, and aim to extract more generalized correlations between generators themselves."

    "We went with a seed generation method that allowed a way to introduce some minor level of entropy to avoid letting the neural network aimlessly swim through the entropy of a strong seed instead of gaining stochastic insight on the data from the PRNG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed generation method we chose derives from the concept of using the system time as an element for seed generation. The specific implementation we chose took inspiration from Microsoft's .NET system.datetime.ticks property. \\cite{msoftdocs} We chose to single out this method due to its documentation and unique simplicity. System time is widely used as a parameter for modern seed generation methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more trivially: \"a pseudo-random number generator is a deterministic algorithm that, given an initial number (called a seed), generates a sequence of numbers that adequately satisfy statistical randomness tests. Since the algorithm is deterministic, the algorithm will always generate the exact same sequence of numbers if it's initialized with the same seed. That's why system time (something that changes all the time) is usually used as the seed for random number generators.\" \\cite{pseudoquote}\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Microsoft documentation, \"A single tick represents one hundred nanoseconds or one ten-millionth of a second. There are 10,000 ticks in a millisecond, or 10 million ticks in a second. The value of this property represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 in the Gregorian calendar.\" \\cite{msoftdocs}\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a fairly similar Python port, as seen in Figure ~\\ref{fig:Default Seeding Method}\n",
    "\n",

    "\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{./Images/Ticks.png}\n",
    "\\caption{Default Seeding Method}\n",
    "\\label{fig:Default Seeding Method}\n",
    "\\end{figure}\n",
    "\n",
    "This python port of Microsoft's tick method can be attributed to \"mhawke\" on StackOverflow. \\cite{tickport} The author had some noteworthy comments about this implementation, namely some porting side effects:\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item UTC times are assumed.\n",
    "    \\item The resolution of the DateTime object is given by DateTime.resolution, which is DateTime.timedelta(0, 0, 1) or microsecond resolution (1e-06 seconds). CSharp Ticks are purported to be 1e-07 seconds.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "For experimental needs, we made additional changes to the implementation:\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item Changing start time from January 1, 0001 to January 1, 1970, which effectively reduced the length of the seed for experimental purposes.\n",
    "    \\item Slicing the last 6 digits of the ticks result to acquire more digit variation for frequent invocation.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "The final modified method allows enough spread between frequently retrieved ticks, where we are assuming reasonable pseudo-unpredictability. This serves as a simplistic but constantly changing control mechanism for being able to seed PRNGs and test experimental outcomes. While not the most cryptographically strong, we needed a way to have some controlled aspect of seed generation to feed into generators of varying cryptographic complexity (to have some baseline of comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original idea was to feed each PRNG different seeds from the same seed generator; however, many PRNG algorithms impose strict seed requirements to pass tests of randomness. Out of the five PRNG methods we implemented, Lagged Fibonacci was the only one that had special seed requirements, so we created a separate seed generator based on the same fundamental ticks generation method, but modified to meet the restrictions. Other PRNGs not implemented in this research that impose seed restrictions include Wichmann-Hill (which accepts three different seeds) and Maximally Periodic Reciprocals (which requires a Sophie Prime), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask: won't different seed generators introduce flaws or bias in the experiment? Well, it depends on what you are testing. In our case, we are strictly testing the \"complexity\" of the generator itself, so supplying a seed that is not blatantly predictable but also not unpredictable was sufficient. Our goal was to allow the characteristics of the generator to be exposed, for we were cracking the \"complexity\" of the generation algorithm, not the complexity of an arbitrary seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\subsection{PRNG Implementations}\n",
    "For the experiment, we chose five PRNG methods by year of invention. We attempted to choose PRNG methods that displayed popularity in the world of pseudo random number generation while making sure the year of invention was reasonably distributed among the group. Choosing five PRNGs allowed us to focus on implementations, while leaving future research opportunities open for working with other PRNGs that we did not cover.\n",

    "A GAN method similar to this could be used in the future during a real-time prediction attack scenario. If attackers are somehow able to break a strong PRNG that is used to generate numbers for cryptographic methods, a method like this could be used as a defense mechanism to prevent (or slow down) further PRN generation cycles from being compromised.\n",
