[Links to Paper and Experimental Design] - Coming Soon.


### How to run the demo 
**Option 1:** The Demo Image (Reduced Docker Image with only the dependencies). Recommended to run the Demo.

[Read tutorial here for setup](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/tree/master/DemoImage) dependency to explore our notebooks!

**Option 2:** The Contribution Image (Jupyter Lab on Docker). Recommended for contributors.

[Read tutorial here for setup](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/blob/master/DockerContainer/README.md)

**Option 3:** 'simple' install 

*Note*: platform-specific tooling issues might occur. With Windows, you will likely have to download the pre-compiled version of different packages (like SciPy and others) from here: [Windows Binaries](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). For Windows, we recommend the Docker Demo Image or the larger Contribution Image. [This](https://python-forum.io/Thread-sklearn-imported-but-not-recognized?pid=19812#pid19812) will get you started down the right path if you insist on this option.
