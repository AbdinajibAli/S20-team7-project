Listed below are the PRNG implementations we want to focus on (this covers most of them from 1946-1998); however, 
ideally we can implement all of the ones in this list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators

    [Middle-square method (1946)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)
    [Lehmer generator (1951)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_random_number_generator)
    [Linear congruential generator (1958)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)
    [Lagged Fibonacci (1965)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagged_Fibonacci_generator)
    [Wichmann-Hill generator (1982)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichmann%E2%80%93Hill)
    [Park-Miller generator (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_random_number_generator)
    [Maximally periodic reciprocals (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain_prime)

'''
There is a list of random number generators we need to find/ create python implementations for. (Wiki links in the project proposal). It looks like the call definition will look something like 

PRNGfunc(seed, n). 
The function should return a list of n generated numbers using the generation method

For example if I call PRNG(seed, 10)
It might return something like
[3,5,10,1,31,17,2,4,6,7]

We will control parsing the n-length list and handling seeds externally. This plays logically with separation of concerns for our usecase.

NOTE: Please read SeedGenerator.py for notes about the seed generation method used.

[Middle-square method (1946)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)

Weakness Note from link ...
For a generator of n-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8n. If the middle n digits are all zeroes, the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero.

    print("Middle_Square")

        # The value of n must be even in order for the method to work ... 
        # It is acceptable to pad the seeds with zeros to the left in order to create an even valued n-digit (eg: 540 → 0540).
        if (seedlength % 2 != 0):  
            seedlength += 1
            seed = str(int(seed)).zfill(seedlength)
        #print("seedlen", seedlength)
        seed = str(int(seed) * int(seed)).zfill(2 * seedlength) #fill leading zeros if seed*seed is less than (2*seed) digits long
        #print("newseed", seed)
        half = int(seedlength / 2)
        seed = seed[(half):(seedlength + half)]
        #print("finalseed", seed)
        #print(seed)

Notes:
If c = 0, the generator is often called a multiplicative congruential generator (MCG), or Lehmer RNG. If c ≠ 0, the method is called a mixed congruential generator.


While the Lehmer RNG can be viewed as a particular case of the linear congruential generator with c=0, it is a special case that implies certain restrictions and properties. In particular, for the Lehmer RNG, the initial seed must be coprime to the modulus m that is not required for LCGs in general. The choice of the modulus m and the multiplier a is also more restrictive for the Lehmer RNG. In contrast to LCG, the maximum period of the Lehmer RNG equals m−1 and it is such when m is prime and a is a primitive root modulo m.

def Lehmer():
    print("Lehmer")

Notes:
The generator is not sensitive to the choice of c, as long as it is relatively prime to the modulus (e.g. if m is a power of 2, then c must be odd), so the value c=1 is commonly chosen. 

If c = 0, the generator is often called a multiplicative congruential generator (MCG), or Lehmer RNG. If c ≠ 0, the method is called a mixed congruential generator.
