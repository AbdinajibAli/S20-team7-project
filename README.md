# S20-team7-project
### Initial Idea:
Create a neural net to predict pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) from a cryptographically weak generator. The input data would be any deterministic data the actual generator uses, (or mathematical ambiguity). The latter is the hard part. We can use output from the actual PRNG chosen as training data.
  


### To Do:
1) Literature Review
2) Choose the Pseudo-Random number generator we will work with
2) Project Proposal (Deadline: Februrary 27th)

### Literature Review:
* [Can a neural network be used to predict the next pseudo random number?](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/3850/can-a-neural-network-be-used-to-predict-the-next-pseudo-random-number)

* [How pseudo random number generators work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)
