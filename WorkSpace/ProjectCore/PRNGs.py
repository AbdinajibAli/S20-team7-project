    Listed below are the PRNG implementations we want to focus on (this covers most of them from 1946-1998); however, 
    we need to implement as many in this list as possible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators

      Done  [Middle-square method (1946)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)
      Done  [Lehmer generator / Park-Miller (1951)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_random_number_generator)
      Done  [Linear congruential generator (1958)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)
      Done  [Lagged Fibonacci (1965)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagged_Fibonacci_generator)
      Done  [Wichmann-Hill generator (1982)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichmann%E2%80%93Hill)
      Done  [Maximally periodic reciprocals (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain_prime)
      Done  [Mersenne Twister (1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister)

    The call definition of any given PRNG function should be as follows:

    PRNGfunc(seed, n, optionalparam=default, anotherparam=default). 

    The function should return a list of n generated numbers using the generation method and all other params outside of seed and n need to have default values.

    For example if I call PRNG(seed, 10)
    It might return something like
    [3,5,10,1,31,17,2,4,6,7]

    We will control parsing the n-length list and handling seeds externally. This plays logically with separation of concerns for our usecase.

    NOTE: Please read SeedGenerator.py for notes about the seed generation method used.

<Middle_Square finished=true/>
<notes>
    Weakness Note:
        For a generator of n-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8n. If the middle n digits are all zeroes, 
        the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent
        numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this
        method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero.
        
    An already_seen list is NOT included in the original middle square method and will not be used.

<Linear_Congruential finished=true/>
<notes>
    The generator is not sensitive to the choice of c, 
    as long as it is relatively prime to the modulus 
    (e.g. if m is a power of 2, then c must be odd), 
    so the value c=1 is commonly chosen.
    

    If c = 0, the generator is often called a multiplicative
    congruential generator (MCG), or Lehmer RNG. If c ≠ 0, the
    method is called a mixed congruential generator.

    Parameters were chosen based on 2^32 in table 2 of 
    https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=BBA0C7ED3ADAB606642BB8D939774B4F?doi=10.1.1.34.1024&rep=rep1&type=pdf

<Lagged_Fibonacci finished=true/>
<notes>
    This is two tap, not three tap...
    It's a "lagged" generator, because "j" and "k" lag behind the generated pseudorandom value. 
    Also, this is called a "two-tap" generator, in that you are using 2 values in the sequence 
    to generate the pseudorandom number. However, a two-tap generator has some problems with 
    randomness tests, such as the Birthday Spacings. Apparently, creating a "three-tap" generator
    addresses this problem.

    Consists of three linear congruential generators with different prime moduli,

<Maximally_Periodic_Reciprocals mneumonic="Sophie German Prime" finished=true/> 
<notes>
    Sophie Germain primes may be used in the generation of pseudo-random numbers.
    The decimal expansion of 1/q will produce a stream of q − 1 pseudo-random digits,
    if q is the safe prime of a Sophie Germain prime p, with p congruent to 3, 9, or 11 (mod 20).
    Thus "suitable" prime numbers q are 7, 23, 47, 59, 167, 179, etc. (OEIS: A000353) 
    (corresponding to p =  3, 11, 23, 29, 83, 89, etc.) (OEIS: A000355). 
    The result is a stream of length q − 1 digits (including leading zeros). 
    So, for example, using q = 23 generates the pseudo-random digits 0, 4, 3, 4, 7, 8, 2, 6, 0, 8, 6, 9, 5, 6, 5, 2, 1, 7, 3, 9, 1, 3.
    Note that these digits are not appropriate for cryptographic purposes, as the value of each can be derived from its predecessor in 
    the digit-stream. 
    
    This only works when you input a prime number that
    a. is a sophie prime.(if p is prime and 2*p + 1 is also a prime, p is a sophie prime)
    b. listlength >= safeprime
    
    --and--
    
    listlength > decprec
    
    Note that this will not accurately return the list length requested. It will return listlength - 2
    
    
    If p is a Sophie Germain prime greater than 3, then p must be congruent to 2 mod 3. 
    For, if not, it would be congruent to 1 mod 3 and 2p + 1 would be congruent to 3 mod 3,
    impossible for a prime number....
    ... We are taking a brute force approach and just checking if the alleged safe prime is indeed prime, instead of 
    checking modulo restrictions to short circuit the operation. This is less efficient, but it is OK for now to brute force it.

<Park-Miller finished=true/>
<notes>

    The Lehmer generator is an lcg. Park Miller is a specific lcg.
    
    The Lehmer random number generator (named after D. H. Lehmer), sometimes also referred to as the Park–Miller random number generator
    (after Stephen K. Park and Keith W. Miller), is a type of linear congruential generator (LCG)
    
    Park miller generator, because they essentially the same. Park-miller request the use of certain modulos, so I am fine with that. Lehmer is an lcg where c = 0...
    If c = 0, the generator is often called a multiplicative congruential generator (MCG), or Lehmer RNG. If c ≠ 0, the method is called a mixed congruential generator.

    While the Lehmer RNG can be viewed as a particular case of the linear congruential generator with c=0, it is a special case that implies certain restrictions and properties.
    In particular, for the Lehmer RNG, the initial seed must be coprime to the modulus m that is not required for LCGs in general. The choice of the modulus m and the multiplier 
    a is also more restrictive for the Lehmer RNG. In contrast to LCG, the maximum period of the Lehmer RNG equals m−1 and it is such when m is prime and a is a primitive root modulo m.
