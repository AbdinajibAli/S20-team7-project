Observation:
Society relies on Pseudo-random numbers for a multitude of reasons. Whether the usecases fall in Information Security or, more broadly, modeling and simulation, we shall not highlight their importance in computing.

We think it is important to not only push the boundary for the modern pseudo random number directly, but to also analyze the history of pseudo randomness to aide in that effort.

Whether true randomness is a inhibition of the human perception or not, there is clear need to push the modern pseudo-random number closer to converging on perceived "true" randomness.

Question:


Hypotheses:
1) We predict there will be a positive trend over time on the cryptographic strength of each subsequent PRNG, given the nature of the increasing importance of stronger PRNGs.

2) We also predict that as we get into cryptographically stronger generation methods, our prediction success rates (even with learning) will be less effective.

3) We expect to uncover correlations in Pseudo-random numbers based on each individual genorator, and aim to extract more generalized correlations between generators themselves.
