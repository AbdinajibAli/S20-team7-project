# S20-team7-project
## To Do
- [X] (Spencer) Modify project proposal to accurately reflect our revised methodology.
- [X] (Spencer) Email all authors of referenced research for code and materials [Check Here](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/blob/master/Email_Inquiry)
- [ ] (Spencer) Correct (append to) Project Proposal based on feedback with a more detailed plan of action. (For documentation purposes)
- [ ] Create core files and import Keras and toolsets
- [ ] (Ali) Find python implementation of the middle-square algorithm adn bring it into the repo. (adjust implementation to 10 numbers?)

### Items reccommended based on feedback:
The length of the set of n-values we will feed into the predictive network needs to be of concrete statistical relevance. (i.e., what is the correct choice of n and how do we statistically prove this?).

What network architectures will be employed? Having a couple of different architectures and listing the applicative advantages/disadvantages will convince everyone we didn't blindly choose a single architecture.  

Adding additional hypothesis around our results with different n-length sets, as well as boundaries for acceptable accuracy.
