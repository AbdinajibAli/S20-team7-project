# How to setup for contribution workflow.
This is also a good way to explore and run the code in general.

Note I am running Windows 10 and using powershell, but the commands are similar for other platforms.

#### Pre-reqs
Have docker installed and setup on your machine correctly. 

Have Git installed and setup on your machine correctly.

#### Instructions
Navigate to where you want your local copy of our repository to be. (for example, I am just putting it on the Desktop)

Type:
```
git clone https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project.git
```
Then Type:
```
cd S20-team7-project
```
Then Type:
```
docker build -t dockercontainer DockerContainer
docker build --rm -f ./ContributionImage/Dockerfile -t contributioncontainer .
```
Before you run the command below, make sure you modify the path "C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Desktop\S20-team7-project\WorkSpace" to reflect your path to the cloned repo. Make sure to include \WorkSpace.

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 --user root -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -e GRANT_SUDO=yes -v C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Desktop\S20-team7-project\WorkSpace:/home/jovyan/WorkSpace dockercontainer
```

**What we are doing here is building a local docker container where we run the Jupyter Lab stack. The /WorkSpace directory in the Docker Container will be mapped to the /WorkSpace folder in your local copy of the repository. This means you can type the docker run command, open up the file you want to work on in Jupyter Lab (via a browser on your local machine), save it, and then submit a pull request. Since all changes get persisted to the /WorkSpace folder within the repo, this is more of an automated workflow, especially if you are trying to contribute.**

**The above saves a lot of hassle... but you can always go the more manual route for contributuion**

Now, to access Jupyter Lab, look for something like this in your command line output:
```
[I 00:11:03.609 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 00:11:03.609 LabApp] http://a3f363a92b41:8888/?token=f35d7cb340c6074d46f9b4c3280b0816c02de3148fa9c2ec
[I 00:11:03.610 LabApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=f35d7cb340c6074d46f9b4c3280b0816c02de3148fa9c2ec
[I 00:11:03.610 LabApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

Copy the url (preferably 2nd one) and paste into your browser. Jupyter Lab should now load. How? Because forwarded the port from the docker container to localhost when we ran the container. 

Note that with this image, there are a lot of extra dependencies that are not critical for our project to run. Navigate to the /WorkSpace Directory and start hacking.

Note that the CSCI4850 Dockerfile does not satisfy all requirements for our project to run. The one addition is the keras-tqdm package; however everything else about the Dockerfile is identical to jlphillipsphd's [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jlphillipsphd/CSCI4850)...

> This container is built on top of jupyter/datascience-notebook provided by jupyter/docker-stacks. It provides a JupyterLab environment with several essential (and non-essential) tools used in CSCI4850/5850 - Neural Networks.
